### Aim: 
To write the prompts for these following prompt types and evaluate that using any one method 1. Straightforward Prompts, 2. Tabular Format Prompting 3.Preceding Question Prompting and 4. Missing Word Prompting

### Explanation -
Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type.

### Procedure:
### 1.	Straightforward Prompts:
• "Define photosynthesis in one sentence."
• "List three advantages of electric vehicles."

### ChatGPT:
### Expected outputs:
- Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight to synthesize food from carbon dioxide and water.
### Advantages of electric vehicles:
1) Environmentally friendly, 2) Lower operating cost, 3) Reduced noise pollution.

### Gemini:
- Photosynthesis is the process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy, typically from the Sun, into chemical energy that can be later released to fuel the organism's activities (in simple   terms, it's how plants make their food).
### Advantages of Electric Vehicles (EVs)
### 1. Lower Emissions:
    EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, contributing to cleaner air in urban areas.
### 2. Reduced Running Costs:
    Electricity is generally cheaper than gasoline, and EVs require less maintenance due to fewer moving parts.
### 3. Quieter Operation:
    Electric motors are significantly quieter than internal combustion engines, leading to less noise pollution.

### 2.Tabular Format Prompting:
•	"Compare and contrast AC and DC current in a table."

### 3. Preceding Question Prompting:
•	"Why is climate change a global concern? Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming."
•	"How do vaccines work? Describe the process of immunization in simple terms."

### ChatGPT:
### Prompt (Preceding Question Style):
"You know that human activities affect the environment and that greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. Based on this, why is climate change a global concern? Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming."
### Expected Answer:
"Climate change is a global concern because it leads to rising temperatures, extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and threats to ecosystems and human health. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, causing the planet to warm and disrupting natural climate patterns."

### Prompt (Preceding Question Style):
"You know that the immune system protects the body from harmful germs. Using this idea, explain how vaccines work and describe the process of immunization in simple terms."
### Expected Answer:
"Vaccines help the body recognize and fight harmful germs without causing the disease. They introduce a harmless part of the germ, like a protein or inactivated virus, which trains the immune system to respond quickly. If the real germ enters later, the body can fight it off effectively, preventing illness."

### GEMINI:
### Prompt:
Climate Change as a Global Concern:
### Expected Output:
Climate change is a global concern because its impacts are far-reaching, interconnected, and pose systemic risks to human society, the economy, and natural ecosystems everywhere.
The main reasons for global concern include:
### Widespread Impact: 
The effects are not limited to one region; they include rising sea levels threatening coastal cities, extreme weather events (like intense heatwaves, floods, and droughts), and disruptions to agriculture and fresh water supply across the planet.
### Economic Stability:
Climate change threatens global economic stability by damaging infrastructure, disrupting supply chains, increasing disaster relief costs, and displacing populations.
### Ecosystem Collapse:
It causes biodiversity loss, ocean acidification, and the destruction of vital natural resources that human societies depend on.
### Disproportionate Impact:
While it affects everyone, it often hits the most vulnerable and poorest communities hardest, exacerbating social inequality and political instability.

### The Role of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) in Global Warming
Greenhouse gases (GHGs) contribute to global warming through a natural process called the greenhouse effect, which has been intensified by human activity.
### Light Penetration: 
The Earth's atmosphere is largely transparent to incoming solar radiation (sunlight), which passes through and heats the Earth's surface.
### Heat Re-radiation:
The Earth's surface then re-radiates this energy back toward space as infrared radiation (heat).
### Trapping Effect: 
Greenhouse gases—such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O)—absorb this outgoing infrared radiation.
### Warming the Planet:
Instead of allowing the heat to escape into space, the GHGs re-emit this radiation in all directions, including back towards the Earth's surface. This process traps heat and warms the lower atmosphere, similar to how glass traps heat in a greenhouse, hence the name.
### Human Amplification:
Since the Industrial Revolution, human activities (primarily the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes) have rapidly increased the concentration of these gases in the atmosphere, leading to an enhanced greenhouse effect and, consequently, global warming.

### Prompt:
How Vaccines Work: The Process of Immunization:
### Expected Output:
### How Do Vaccines Work?
Vaccines work by safely training the body's immune system to recognize and fight off a specific germ (a virus or bacteria). They introduce a harmless version of the germ—or just a component of it—to the body without causing the actual disease.

### The Process of Immunization in Simple Terms
Immunization is the process by which a person becomes protected from a disease through vaccination. It generally follows these steps:
### The Introduction (The Shot):'
A vaccine is administered. This vaccine contains antigens, which are parts of the germ or a weakened/inactive form of the whole germ. These antigens are the unique features of the pathogen that the immune system needs to learn to recognize.
### The Training (The Immune Response):
-The immune system detects these antigens and treats them as a genuine threat, even though they are harmless. It launches a response:
-It creates antibodies, which are specialized proteins that attach to the antigens and neutralize the germ.
-It produces specialized white blood cells called memory cells.
### The Memory (The Protection):
The memory cells are the key to long-term immunity. They "remember" the specific germ and how to fight it. If the vaccinated person is exposed to the real, harmful germ later, the memory cells activate quickly and flood the body with the right antibodies to destroy the germ before it can cause illness.
### Herd Immunity (Community Protection): 
When enough people in a community are immunized, it provides "herd immunity," which protects even those who cannot be vaccinated (like infants or people with compromised immune systems), because the disease cannot easily spread.

### 4. Missing Word Prompting:
